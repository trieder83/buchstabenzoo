# Brief — `env_koala`

Spec: ART-ENVIRONMENT, GAME-LEVEL-2. Status: **brief — images not generated yet**. Layout: `layout.md` in this
folder; level data `assets/levels/level-2.toml`.

## Purpose

Start of the koala mission: the child reads the sign and the info board (riddle → tree house / giant tree / blossom tree, food word → eucalyptus). Empty at level start; later home of the koala **pair** (GAME-FAMILY) with the feeding trough.

## Must be visible

- Wooden post-and-rail fence 8 × 10 m, gate on the east side facing the ring path; enclosure sign with the koala silhouette above the gate, info board next to it.
- Two eucalyptus trees of normal height (grey-green narrow leaves, pale trunks), a climbing trunk with forks, a small wooden shelter, the feeding trough.
- The ring path in front, the map board and the entry path at the bottom edge.

## Must not appear

- No tree taller than the others, no blossoms, no tree house (these are the koala hiding places).
- No koalas (empty at level start).

## Props used

Modular (ART-ENVIRONMENT list): `fence_wood`, `gate_wood`, `enclosure_sign`, `info_board`, `path_tile`, `grass_tuft`, `bush`, `feeding_trough`, `tree`, `hedge`, `map_board`.
Unique models: `koala_shelter`, `eucalyptus_tree`.

## Mood

Calm and cosy, soft grey-green.

## Image settings

| File | Aspect / size | Camera (level coordinates, see `layout.md`) |
|---|---|---|
| `overview.png` | 16:9, 1920 × 1080 (SDXL: 1344 × 768) | Camera yaw west (image top = west), pitch ≈ 62°, target (31, 38), about 22 m from the target; frame covers the enclosure and the ring path in front. |
| `player_view.png` | 9:16, 1080 × 1920 (SDXL: 768 × 1344) | Player next to the board on `path_l2_ring_w` at (37.5, 39.5); camera yaw west (image top = west), pitch ≈ 55°, ≈ 14 m from the player. |
| `player_view_landscape.png` *(optional)* | 16:9, 1920 × 1080 | same as player view |

Camera, aspect ratios and consistency tips: as in `art/environment/loc_pond/brief.md` (high-angle
view like a cozy zoo park simulation game, Q-049; style frame as style reference; one fixed seed
per area; guided workflow from the level greybox, ART-PIPELINE §7).

## Prompts

**Style:** the first paragraph of every prompt is the STYLE block from `art/style/style.md`
(verbatim, comic style — Q-010 answered); every negative prompt ends with its NEGATIVE
suffix. Never edit those blocks here — change `art/style/style.md` and all briefs together.

### `overview.png`

Comic-style 3D cartoon game art with a cel-shaded look: bold clean dark-brown outlines around every object, flat colour areas with one hard-edged shadow tone, simple rounded chunky shapes with friendly exaggerated proportions, big expressive eyes on people and animals, like a colourful children's comic book brought into 3D. No gradients, no fine texture detail, no noise. Bright warm midday sunlight from the upper left, crisp hard-edged shadows. Friendly saturated palette: fresh grass green, warm wood brown, light sand-beige paths, light stone grey, water blue, white. Clean, uncluttered, child-friendly, cheerful mobile game look, crisp focus across the whole image.

Elevated three-quarter top-down view like a cozy zoo park simulation game: a high camera looking down at about 60 to 65 degrees, isometric-like perspective with a narrow field of view so vertical lines stay nearly parallel, horizontal widescreen composition, the whole area in frame and neatly laid out like a diorama, the ground fills the image, no horizon, no sky.

An empty koala enclosure in a small cartoon zoo seen from high above: a wooden post-and-rail fence around a lawn about 8 by 10 m, two medium-height eucalyptus trees with pale smooth trunks and narrow grey-green leaves, a climbing trunk with forks, a small wooden shelter and a wooden feeding trough. A wooden gate in the fence faces a sandy path; above the gate an enclosure sign with a black koala silhouette, next to it an info board tilted towards the camera. The player character, a small girl about 7 years old (1.2 m tall, head about one third of her body height), long straight dark-brown hair down her back, white T-shirt with four horizontal blue stripes, brown belt, blue jeans, dark-brown shoes walks along the path at the bottom of the image. Zoo world: light sand-beige paths of square paving blocks, wooden post-and-rail fences, tall dark-green hedges about 3 m high, round-topped trees, short green grass.

All signs and boards are blank: plain wooden or cream-coloured panels without any letters, words or numbers. The only markings allowed are a simple solid black animal silhouette on an enclosure sign and simple pictogram icons (shovel, padlock) on barrier signs. Enclosure signs and info boards are tilted back towards the camera so their faces are clearly visible from above.

In-game view of a cozy zoo park simulation game, vertical phone-screen composition: a high follow camera looking down at about 55 degrees from about 14 m away, isometric-like perspective with a narrow field of view so vertical lines stay nearly parallel, no horizon, no sky. The small girl is seen from above near the centre of the image, her figure about one twelfth of the image height; the area around her, about 12 m across, is clearly laid out and readable: paths, fences and enclosures easy to tell apart.

Seen from above: The player character, a small girl about 7 years old (1.2 m tall, head about one third of her body height), long straight dark-brown hair down her back, white T-shirt with four horizontal blue stripes, brown belt, blue jeans, dark-brown shoes, stands in the centre of the image. The upper half of the image is the empty koala enclosure with two medium-height eucalyptus trees, a climbing trunk and a small wooden shelter behind a wooden fence; the gate with a koala-silhouette sign and the info board are right in front of the girl. Zoo world: light sand-beige paths of square paving blocks, wooden post-and-rail fences, tall dark-green hedges about 3 m high, round-topped trees, short green grass.

All signs and boards are blank: plain wooden or cream-coloured panels without any letters, words or numbers. The only markings allowed are a simple solid black animal silhouette on an enclosure sign and simple pictogram icons (shovel, padlock) on barrier signs. Enclosure signs and info boards are tilted back towards the camera so their faces are clearly visible from above.

### `player_view_landscape.png` (optional, 16:9)

Same as `player_view.png`, but replace the camera paragraph with:

## Review checklist (before `concept_approved = true` — user decides)

- [ ] Clearly a koala home without any koala: eucalyptus trees, climbing trunk.
- [ ] Nothing that looks like the tree house, the giant tree or the blossom tree.
- [ ] Style matches the approved style frame (Q-010).
- [ ] Layout matches `layout.md` and the GAME-LEVEL-2 map (positions, sizes, what is left/right).
- [ ] All signs, boards and labels blank — only animal silhouettes on enclosure signs; no text artefacts anywhere.
- [ ] Bright, friendly, nothing scary; no cages.
- [ ] High camera as specified (pitch, girl ≈ 1/12 of the image height near the centre, no sky); verticals nearly parallel.
- [ ] Readable from the high camera at phone size (view the image at ~25 %).
- [ ] Every prop visible is in the ART-ENVIRONMENT modular list or listed as a unique model in `layout.md`.
