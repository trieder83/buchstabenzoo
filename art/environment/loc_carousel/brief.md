Spec: ART-ENVIRONMENT, GAME-LEVEL-3, CONT-MISSIONS. Status: **brief — images not generated yet**. Layout: `layout.md` in this
folder; level data `assets/levels/level-3.toml`.

## Purpose

The monkey on the carousel: *"Ich reite gern. Mein Pferd ist aus Holz. Alles dreht sich!"* Shown in the **found** state. One of three candidate hiding places of its animal (discovery, GAME-RESCUE §1); the approved image is also cropped for the `kiga` picture of this place.

## Must be visible

- A small **carousel** with painted **wooden horses** under a **striped round roof**, slowly turning.
- The monkey riding backwards on a horse.

## Must not appear

- No ship, no trampoline.

## Props used

Modular (ART-ENVIRONMENT list): `path_tile`, `grass_tuft`, `water_tile_flowing`, `hedge`, `bench`.
Unique models: `carousel`.
Hiding places shown: `loc_carousel`.

## Mood

Merry and musical.

## Image settings

| File | Aspect / size | Camera (level coordinates, see `layout.md`) |
|---|---|---|
| `overview.png` | 16:9, 1920 × 1080 (SDXL: 1344 × 768) | Camera yaw north (image top = north), pitch ≈ 62°, target (-13, 54), about 16 m from the target; frame covers the carousel, the stream on the left, the side path on the right. |
| `player_view.png` | 9:16, 1080 × 1920 (SDXL: 768 × 1344) | Player on `path_l3_south` at (-8, 54); camera yaw north (image top = north), pitch ≈ 55°, ≈ 14 m from the player. |
| `player_view_landscape.png` *(optional)* | 16:9, 1920 × 1080 | same as player view |

Camera, aspect ratios and consistency tips: as in `art/environment/loc_pond/brief.md` (high-angle
view like a cozy zoo park simulation game, Q-049; style frame as style reference; one fixed seed
per area; guided workflow from the level greybox, ART-PIPELINE §7).

## Prompts

**Style:** the first paragraph of every prompt is the STYLE block from `art/style/style.md`
(verbatim, comic style — Q-010 answered); every negative prompt ends with its NEGATIVE
suffix. Never edit those blocks here — change `art/style/style.md` and all briefs together.

### `overview.png`

```text
Comic-style 3D cartoon game art with a cel-shaded look: bold clean dark-brown outlines around every object, flat colour areas with one hard-edged shadow tone, simple rounded chunky shapes with friendly exaggerated proportions, big expressive eyes on people and animals, like a colourful children's comic book brought into 3D. No gradients, no fine texture detail, no noise. Bright warm midday sunlight from the upper left, crisp hard-edged shadows. Friendly saturated palette: fresh grass green, warm wood brown, light sand-beige paths, light stone grey, water blue, white. Clean, uncluttered, child-friendly, cheerful mobile game look, crisp focus across the whole image.

Elevated three-quarter top-down view like a cozy zoo park simulation game: a high camera looking down at about 60 to 65 degrees, isometric-like perspective with a narrow field of view so vertical lines stay nearly parallel, horizontal widescreen composition, the whole area in frame and neatly laid out like a diorama, the ground fills the image, no horizon, no sky.

A small carousel with painted wooden horses under a red-and-white striped round roof in a small cartoon zoo seen from high above. A cheeky friendly cartoon monkey rides backwards on one of the horses, laughing. A narrow clear stream on the left, a sandy path on the right, a tall hedge at the bottom. The player character, a small girl about 7 years old (1.2 m tall, head about one third of her body height), long straight dark-brown hair down her back, white T-shirt with four horizontal blue stripes, brown belt, blue jeans, dark-brown shoes walks along the path at the bottom of the image. Zoo world: light sand-beige paths of square paving blocks, wooden post-and-rail fences, tall dark-green hedges about 3 m high, round-topped trees, short green grass.

All signs and boards are blank: plain wooden or cream-coloured panels without any letters, words or numbers. The only markings allowed are a simple solid black animal silhouette on an enclosure sign and simple pictogram icons (shovel, padlock) on barrier signs. Enclosure signs and info boards are tilted back towards the camera so their faces are clearly visible from above.

In-game view of a cozy zoo park simulation game, vertical phone-screen composition: a high follow camera looking down at about 55 degrees from about 14 m away, isometric-like perspective with a narrow field of view so vertical lines stay nearly parallel, no horizon, no sky. The small girl is seen from above near the centre of the image, her figure about one twelfth of the image height; the area around her, about 12 m across, is clearly laid out and readable: paths, fences and enclosures easy to tell apart.

Seen from above: The player character, a small girl about 7 years old (1.2 m tall, head about one third of her body height), long straight dark-brown hair down her back, white T-shirt with four horizontal blue stripes, brown belt, blue jeans, dark-brown shoes, stands in the centre of the image. The upper half of the image is the carousel with its striped roof and wooden horses; a cheeky friendly cartoon monkey rides on a horse. Zoo world: light sand-beige paths of square paving blocks, wooden post-and-rail fences, tall dark-green hedges about 3 m high, round-topped trees, short green grass.
