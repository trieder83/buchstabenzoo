# Brief — `loc_tallest_tree`

Spec: ART-ENVIRONMENT, GAME-LEVEL-2, CONT-MISSIONS. Status: **brief — images not generated yet**. Layout: `layout.md` in this
folder; level data `assets/levels/level-2.toml`.

## Purpose

The koala pair at the very top of the tallest tree of the zoo: *"Wir sitzen ganz oben. Nichts im Zoo ist höher. Wir sehen alles!"* Shown in the **found** state. One of three candidate hiding places of its animal (discovery, GAME-RESCUE §1); the approved image is also cropped for the `kiga` picture of this place.

## Must be visible

- A **giant tree, 12 m**, clearly **twice as tall** as every other tree around, with a **very thick trunk**.
- The two koalas in the topmost branches (≈ 9 m).
- The short path from the south, the elephant enclosure fence on the left, the zoo wall on the right.

## Must not appear

- No other tree nearly as tall.
- No blossoms, no tree house.

## Props used

Modular (ART-ENVIRONMENT list): `tree`, `path_tile`, `fence_wood`, `zoo_wall`, `grass_tuft`.
Unique models: `tree_giant`.
Hiding places shown: `loc_tallest_tree`.

## Mood

Majestic and a little bit wondrous.

## Image settings

| File | Aspect / size | Camera (level coordinates, see `layout.md`) |
|---|---|---|
| `overview.png` | 16:9, 1920 × 1080 (SDXL: 1344 × 768) | Camera yaw north (image top = north), pitch ≈ 62°, target (69, 31), about 22 m from the target; frame covers the giant tree with the path below it and the elephant fence on the left. |
| `player_view.png` | 9:16, 1080 × 1920 (SDXL: 768 × 1344) | Player at the end of `path_l2_e` at (68, 28); camera yaw north (image top = north), pitch ≈ 55°, ≈ 14 m from the player. |
| `player_view_landscape.png` *(optional)* | 16:9, 1920 × 1080 | same as player view |

Camera, aspect ratios and consistency tips: as in `art/environment/loc_pond/brief.md` (high-angle
view like a cozy zoo park simulation game, Q-049; style frame as style reference; one fixed seed
per area; guided workflow from the level greybox, ART-PIPELINE §7).

## Prompts

**Style:** the first paragraph of every prompt is the STYLE block from `art/style/style.md`
(verbatim, comic style — Q-010 answered); every negative prompt ends with its NEGATIVE
suffix. Never edit those blocks here — change `art/style/style.md` and all briefs together.

### `overview.png`

```text
Comic-style 3D cartoon game art with a cel-shaded look: bold clean dark-brown outlines around every object, flat colour areas with one hard-edged shadow tone, simple rounded chunky shapes with friendly exaggerated proportions, big expressive eyes on people and animals, like a colourful children's comic book brought into 3D. No gradients, no fine texture detail, no noise. Bright warm midday sunlight from the upper left, crisp hard-edged shadows. Friendly saturated palette: fresh grass green, warm wood brown, light sand-beige paths, light stone grey, water blue, white. Clean, uncluttered, child-friendly, cheerful mobile game look, crisp focus across the whole image.

Elevated three-quarter top-down view like a cozy zoo park simulation game: a high camera looking down at about 60 to 65 degrees, isometric-like perspective with a narrow field of view so vertical lines stay nearly parallel, horizontal widescreen composition, the whole area in frame and neatly laid out like a diorama, the ground fills the image, no horizon, no sky.

One giant round-topped tree in a small cartoon zoo seen from high above, twice as tall as the normal trees around it, with a massive thick trunk. In the very top branches sit two small cute grey koalas with huge fluffy round ears and big black noses. A short sandy path leads to its foot; on the left the wooden fence of an elephant enclosure with a tiled pool, on the right a stone zoo wall. The tree is drawn so that its height is clearly readable from the high camera: its crown casts a long shadow and towers over the other treetops. The player character, a small girl about 7 years old (1.2 m tall, head about one third of her body height), long straight dark-brown hair down her back, white T-shirt with four horizontal blue stripes, brown belt, blue jeans, dark-brown shoes walks along the path at the bottom of the image. Zoo world: light sand-beige paths of square paving blocks, wooden post-and-rail fences, tall dark-green hedges about 3 m high, round-topped trees, short green grass.

All signs and boards are blank: plain wooden or cream-coloured panels without any letters, words or numbers. The only markings allowed are a simple solid black animal silhouette on an enclosure sign and simple pictogram icons (shovel, padlock) on barrier signs. Enclosure signs and info boards are tilted back towards the camera so their faces are clearly visible from above.

In-game view of a cozy zoo park simulation game, vertical phone-screen composition: a high follow camera looking down at about 55 degrees from about 14 m away, isometric-like perspective with a narrow field of view so vertical lines stay nearly parallel, no horizon, no sky. The small girl is seen from above near the centre of the image, her figure about one twelfth of the image height; the area around her, about 12 m across, is clearly laid out and readable: paths, fences and enclosures easy to tell apart.

Seen from above: The player character, a small girl about 7 years old (1.2 m tall, head about one third of her body height), long straight dark-brown hair down her back, white T-shirt with four horizontal blue stripes, brown belt, blue jeans, dark-brown shoes, stands in the centre of the image. The upper half of the image is the enormous trunk and crown of the giant tree, much bigger than all other trees; two small cute grey koalas with huge fluffy round ears and big black noses are high up in the crown. Zoo world: light sand-beige paths of square paving blocks, wooden post-and-rail fences, tall dark-green hedges about 3 m high, round-topped trees, short green grass.

All signs and boards are blank: plain wooden or cream-coloured panels without any letters, words or numbers.

### `player_view_landscape.png` (optional, 16:9)

Same as `player_view.png`, but replace the camera paragraph with:

## Review checklist (before `concept_approved = true` — user decides)

- [ ] All riddle details readable from above: tallest tree, thick trunk.
- [ ] The tree is clearly the tallest (height readable from above, e.g. by its shadow and crown size).
- [ ] Koalas visible at the top.
- [ ] Style matches the approved style frame (Q-010).
- [ ] Layout matches `layout.md` and the GAME-LEVEL-2 map (positions, sizes, what is left/right).
- [ ] All signs, boards and labels blank — only animal silhouettes on enclosure signs; no text artefacts anywhere.
- [ ] Bright, friendly, nothing scary; no cages.
- [ ] High camera as specified (pitch, girl ≈ 1/12 of the image height near the centre, no sky); verticals nearly parallel.
- [ ] Readable from the high camera at phone size (view the image at ~25 %).
- [ ] Every prop visible is in the ART-ENVIRONMENT modular list or listed as a unique model in `layout.md`.
